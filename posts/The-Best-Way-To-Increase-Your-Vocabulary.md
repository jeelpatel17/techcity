**_One simple technique that skyrocketed my English learning!_**

I still remember, when I was learning English(even though I completed my elementary education from an English medium school! this is a real problem in India, but we’ll talk about that later in some other article) I used to watch a lot of English movies, listen to a lot of English songs (Eminem, JB, Kendrick Lamar are a few of ‘em), talk to myself a lot in English, blah and blah. But one thing I noticed during all of them was that every time I heard of a new word, I use to search that word’s meaning immediately and after a few days, forget it, But if I heard that word again, I’d know that I had searched it, but don’t know its meaning, and then again I would search that word’s meaning, and that’s how my rich vocabulary box was built. I was tired of mugging up a long list of words and not be able to use it when needed, but I got this amazing ninja technique to build a good lexical resource of mine, hence passing out with you too!

## What kind of movies should you watch/songs you listen to?

Watch your favorite genre of movies/music, But as well as watch/listen to those topics which are going to help you in your intention of learning English, whether it be for studying abroad, business purposes, or for a good job. Hence, if you’re wishing to study abroad, watch movies which are related to your studies and foreign culture, if you’re hoping to learn English for business purpose than watch entrepreneurial movies like The Founder, and Wolf of the Wall Street, and if you want to enhance your communication skills, there are movies like The Pursuit of Happyness and The Social Network! Just find a way out of the problem, remember

**_If There’s a Will, There’s a Way._**

## What you’ve to do now?

Start watching English movies(even with captions, if you need), listen to English songs, and carefully hear the words used in the lyrics, and just after getting a new word every time, search it immediately with a few of its examples, and don’t mug up! just learn it, don’t worry if you remember it or not. After a few weeks, see your vocab graph changing with a drastic improvement.

Now, I want to share with you a fun incident happened this morning with me, I was just coming out of the bathroom after having a bath and there I saw a tiny baby cockroach, and say what, I was talking to him in English! You can now estimate my willingness to learn English according to that, often I talk to myself in English and say so many sentences and learn every time from it.

**So, that was my today’s morning, filled with enthusiasm and dedication!**
