Most of the people find their passion after completing high school or maybe after completing primary school, But here’s how you can know your child’s passion or the right direction of your child towards a successful life even before he/she completes primary school!

## How does a successful life build?

According to my experience and findings, a child consciously or subconsciously finds his/her passion for something in their late childhood, BUT uh uh! this is not how I assumed my blog about successful life would be, let’s first see the whole timeline of a successful life!

## 1. Dipping toes

First above all, when a child gets their basic understanding of the most basic things of the world, they’re highly curious at that age stage, Let me tell you my story, I used to ask a lot of questions (and still do) when I was like, maybe 9 - 10 years old, even I got a nickname of 'Question mark' from my family and friends, BUT it eventually paid off as I got another nickname 'Google' while I was in my secondary school and also I loved to learn different spellings, not to brag, but once a teacher asked the whole class the spelling of 'committee’, perhaps I was in 2nd grade at that time, all students were raising their hand (including me), but all of a sudden, the teacher said that if the spelling will be wrong then that student will get a nice slap on their face, and now no hand was up there in the air except mine, at that time the teacher was fascinated by this confidence of mine, and that was the moment I still remember! So, that’s my story about how I was curious (and still am) during my elementary school, and after that, I fell in love with computers, as my father had one, I used to play games, but that’s the most regrettable thing I ever did, that to just play games like GTA and Mario, I never went beyond that and now I regret it so much, But everyone has had a certain past that they want to forget, and I had one too, So now I never waste my time doing useless things, I make sure to be productive every second of my life. So, getting to the topic again, the main thing is to be curious, you’ve to be curious about something, if you get amazed by art and music, just go get its information as more as you can, the main thing is to be curious about everything, ask a lot of questions, even if you’re not in that field, you’ll be benefited in future for sure. Hence, the first step in anyone’s successful life is to be curious, you must always have that why, how and what in your mind, some people are worried about others, how others will react about the question, how silly is your question is, But listen to me, don’t give a damn about them, they don’t have that perspective to ask a question and criticizing you for their disability, they’ll not be with you after 10 years, you’ve to improve yourself despite all the criticism, deep down you know that you’re doing the right thing, so get that 'Whyman' out of you.

**_“Only information is not enough if you don’t know how to implement it in the real life”_**

## 2. Diving deeep

The Next Step will be the exploration of ways how you can go deep in that field of interest and get expertise over everything in your field, Let’s start after you start asking questions and get enough information to step ahead, you need to find ways in which you can implement your expertise, and even make a few bucks out of it, if you’re a software geek you need to find the practical ways through which you can help people to solve their problems out, only information is not enough if you don’t know how to implement it, So find your ways to use it in such a practical way and help people, and don’t forget “if you help people by any means, you can demand any price”.

## 3. The power of being remote

Now, I think that if you’re an expert in some sort of field and you know enough ways to teach someone, then there’s nothing wrong in giving back to the society, and by doing that you can also improve your soft skills while you’re teaching, this is the era of the digital revolution, you can teach a student from China just by sitting at your comfort in the US, and if you aren’t comfortable teaching one on one, then you can start a video course which you record once and anyone can access it till eternity, exactly like youtube lectures.

**_That was my thinking of a timeline a successful person has! Let me know if you got any other perspective than mine, I'd love to get your opinion!_**
