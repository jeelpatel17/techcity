**_Simple steps to get your English skyrocketed_**

The most crucial part about learning English is to get the words out when we're speaking, but unfortunately, not everybody can do this, even if we're having a huge pile of words in our brain, but why it isn't coming out when needed? Here's the most efficient way to conquer that, and the best part about these tricks is that you'll enjoy the whole process while learning!

## Why words aren't coming out when needed?

Most people tend to do grasp a chunk of words and expect to utter it out when speaking, they prepare a list and learn it by rote, but they never try to master a word and embed it into their daily life. Make sentences while you're walking, working, or living! that's how you'll master sentence structure. Let's get into these master tips to learn English well.

## 1. Watch, Hear, Speak & Think in English

The **WHST** method is best to learn English, which is the essence that you need to master English.

- **WATCH**

  If you’re watching a TV Show in your language, you’ll have your languages words and phrases in your mind, and in your subconscious mind throughout the day and night, so what you need to do is switch your local channels into English channels, whether it be News or Movies or English TV Shows, this is how you will learn 3 things at a time — Vocabulary, Sentence Structure, and Word Pronunciation. Also, the English cartoon channels contain very basic English which can be understood by children, hence, it is your way to go!.

- **HEAR**

  If you’re like me having an environment in which no one ever talks in English or know how to speak English, you’ll be pretty disappointed to not having a partner with whom you can practice your English. Now, if you watch in English, you’ll also hear that, but if you want to do more than that, there are tonnes of English podcasts out there, and I’d like to suggest you go with the local podcasts in which you learn your own country’s English accent, and that’s how you learn how everyone in your country speaks English, and get a kickstart to your learning journey!

- **SPEAK**

  I remember when I was also struggling to learn English, I also joined English classes twice, but nothing was growing out, and at that time I used to talk to myself so often in a day, it was like my own friend, and that's how I started to talk to myself in English, and you can do it too if you don't have that environment to support you practicing English. I know there are many English speaking apps in which you can speak with a native speaker, but also I wasn't able to afford it as it was in dollars and you know how much it reaches when converted into my currency. So, coming to the point, always remember

  **_“Give yourself time, your first priority should be you.”_**

  _— Sanjay Raval (Gujarati Motivational Speaker)_

  You need to talk to yourself about how the day went, how was the dinner, what are your goals, speak every sentence in English which you can speak comfortably in your language. if you're watching tv or listening to songs, translate it into your mind from English to your language and vice versa, that's the key to having rich vocabulary.

- **THINK**

  Ever had some scenario in which you’re in an awkward place, or cursing anyone in your mind, that’s what you need to modify a bit, just change the language of thinking and see how your English starts improving day by day, I was like ‘ Woah, Why I didn’t know this trick before! ’. Let me explain this process to you in simple words. If you’re speaking in your language, you’ll tend to speak without thinking of any word that can bespoke, but in English, you start thinking what word to say! Why is that? Because your mind is rich in your own language’s vocabulary, and Now you’ve to think in English every time you’re planning, processing, or cursing in your mind, that’s how you’ll fill your mind with English vocabulary, and you’ll know the change after a few weeks of following this trick!

## 2. Learn English idioms/phrases

Every time Idioms works like charm! After you follow watching in English trick, you’ll notice that native English speakers are very likely to add an idiom every time they speak, like 'In a nutshell' (mean ing — in short), 'piece of cake' (meaning  — very easy), 'cup of tea' (mean ing — something you’re good at) and you know the best part of learning it? It is so fun to speak! Unless the complex English words, you can use it in your day to day life, there are tonnes of idioms you can learn right away!

## 3. Record your voice and upload it on youtube

After you record it, you'll find yourself doing mistakes you never wanted to do! and why to upload it on youtube? Because youtube has a great feature of identifying English and generating its subtitles automatically, now you've to notice if the subtitles are exactly what you spoke than congrats! you've achieved the pronunciation trophy.! Now, if you're uncomfortable making your voice public, then for what is that privacy - private button on youtube? By doing this, you'll notice how you use natural fillers, how your sentence structure is, and how your word pronunciation is! So, never be ashamed of it, you can record it when no one's there and analyze your mistakes, there's nothing wrong in learning through analyzing!

## 4. Perform 'The Cow Method'

The best method I’ve ever used! It is so simple anyone can learn it in just a few minutes, this is how it’s done―You need to pick a simple word like 'Cow' and quickly make sentences with it, like this ― “Cow is an animal, animals are cute, cute is also my teddy bear, a teddy bear is a stuffed toy, stuffed toys are sometimes so expensive, things and services are getting so expensive nowadays, and so on…” This is How you’d master english!
After following these four steps, you need consistency and patience, consistency builds a backbone of English in you, and patience is needed in everything you do, obviously, Rome wasn’t built in a single day, so get yourself a patience quote NOW!

So get yourself enough time and consistency, and I'll see you next week!
