## Let's get a little deep...

Ever wondered why most people are stressed these days, and not because of their workload or responsibilities, But because of their habits, wise men once said that
**Habits are what defines a human**.
That's what you need to implement and improve in your life, BUT I'm not going to tell you that same 21-day habit story again, instead what I'll tell you in these five minutes is to what to do while you're walking or commuting from one place to another -- and it is so effective in your daily tasks, I myself have adopted this since years, Hence without any further boasting, let's jump into the main content!

## What is Anti-Face Habit?

I've coined this word according to how it works (yeah, it sounds a bit funny). What it does is to remove the misc trash from your subconscious mind, let's take an example, to better understand it, Let's pretend that you've your workplace a few minutes away from your home and you walk daily to your job and find too many peoples, vehicles and random things on your way, Now, when you reach your workplace, you've your subconscious mind half or maybe full with the way thoughts and faces which you gone past through on your way, Now you need to focus in your work, But you're not able to do that, Why? Because of the faces, vehicles, and random things that came on your way in the morning is still processing in your subconscious mind. If you're a social person too, you must give it a try!

## How to follow this Habit?

This is very simple, you just need to see anywhere else except people's faces and the random things that came along your way! I use to see the walking path, and it's definitely normal! I bet you'd appreciate it and definitely will get results in....maybe one week, all readers should give this a shot.

**<p align="center">I won't say that this will definitely change your life as different people have different personalities, likes, and dislikes, But you must give it a shot and see what goes by!</p>**
