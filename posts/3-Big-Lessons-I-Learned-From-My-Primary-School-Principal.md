Everyone has had that boring and arrogant principal or teacher while in primary school and have a hateful relationship with their principal because they’re being strict and schooly things like that. I was also one of a kind like that, but after I completed my primary school and now I’m in a college, I’ve realized that there were certain lessons from my primary school principal which I ignored were making a lot of sense and were depicting the world’s scenario, and how the world works! I’m gonna share those lessons with you, so you can also tell them to your child or your loved ones’ child.

## 1. ‘Whoever wants to do, does!’

I’m sure that you’d not get this one right away after reading it, give me a chance! So, I still remember that my principal used to this phrase every time we children were doing some kind of mischief or not good at studies, but now I realized what she was trying to say, that is ‘Where there’s a will, there’s a way!’. I realized that if anyone wants to do something or achieve some goal, he/she achieves it, without any excuses and arguments, just pure will power and dedication!

## 2. ‘My Life is Blank White Paper and it died like a Blank White Paper’

My principal was reciting this maybe 3–4 times a day (not in English, but Hindi — Mera jivan kora kagaz, kora hi reh gaya), but it did pay off! (to some students at least). Let me tell you what she’s trying to convince with this, she use to tell that our lives are like a blank paper and our actions are like the letters on it, the moment we’re born, the almighty God sanctions a fresh warm blank paper from a printer, and now you’ve to fill it nicely with good deeds and with golden letters to be a role model for someone, and whenever I remember this, my brain also bombs out a famous quote of ‘unknown’

**_"Your Life is Your Message to the World, Make Sure it’s Inspiring"_**

**— Unknown**

She also used to say in its full version in Hindi — “ Mera jivan kora kagaz kora hi reh gaya, hawa ka jhaunka aaya aur udd gaya! ”, English translated — “ My life is a blank white paper, and when an air gust blew, it flowed like the trash in a hurricane.” So, don’t waste your lives partying and gossiping with friends, make sure your life’s paper isn’t blank on the death bed, fill it with good deeds, and don’t let any wind gust to blow your life’s paper into the never-ending hurricane of negativity.

## 3. Whose problem is it?

Whenever I use to forget my homework notebook at home and tell her that the very next day, she used to scold me with that phrase, “Whose problem is it?” and every time I used to hate her more and more because I didn’t know that simple phrase will teach me some lesson later in my life, now I realize that in the real world, if you haven’t done something, maybe you’ve gone for an interview and forgot your needed documents, you aren’t going to tell the hr officer that you forgot those documents at home, it is not his problem, that is your problem that you forgot them at home, that was the lesson I got earlier in my primary school. If my homework wasn’t available, then that was ultimately my problem!

**_Now after ~5 years, I realize how she was teaching me the important aspects of life, and training me to face it._**
