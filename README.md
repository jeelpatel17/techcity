<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/jeelpatel17/techcity/blob/main/public/images/screenstabbed.jpg)

<p align="center">
TechCity | Every Tech Matters.
  
It is my personal blog which I made for brushing up my React skills and learning Next JS as well, also for populating my portfolio.
</p>
  
Topics on which my blog is/will be filled up with:
* Coding Problems & Solutions
* Software installing guides
* Self help & Neuroscience

Of course, you can suggest me a topic for my next blog, as well as send your blog to get published as a *Guest Writer*!

I'm adding as many functionalities/features that I can, if you want to contribute, jump in! We'll rock together!.

### Built With

Not much, sprinkled a little pixie dust, and garnished with love.
* [Next JS](https://nextjs.org)
* [NProgress](https://github.com/rstacruz/nprogress)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
* [Vercel](https://vercel.com)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

You can fork it or clone it with your separate branch, both ways will work just fine!

### Prerequisites

Latest version of npm is recommended, .
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1. You can use all three - Command Line/Terminal/Git Bash for cloning the repo.
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh

### Contributing
(Step-by-step)

The backend is maintained very peacefully, and you don't have to worry about its hosting.
- The blog is hosted upon Vercel itself, and you just need to push the changes to your branch
- The repo moderators will lookout for potential merges if it is eligible
- Then it'll give a link where everyone will be able to see changes that you've made without even merging it to the main branch! 
- If the merge will be seem good, then it'll get merged, and deployed by Vercel itself, no efforts involved!
